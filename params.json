{"name":"Cutup","body":"##About\r\n[Jumpcut](http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net/) has always been a great tool for managing clipboards.  It does one thing, and one thing only:  clipboard buffering.  No \"useful features\" that end up getting in your way, no \"productivity enhancements\" that you'll never use; just plain vanilla clipboard buffering.  Unfortunately, Jumpcut only works with plain text.  Cutup aims to do better.  Designed to emulate the look and feel of Jumpcut, Cutup's #2 goal (after buffering your clipboard) is staying out of your way.\r\n\r\n##Status\r\nCutup is approaching the state of a somewhat usable beta, but I wouldn't trust it just yet.\r\n","tagline":"Slightly less-than-minimalist clipboard buffering for Mac OS X.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
