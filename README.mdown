#Cutup
Slightly less-than-minimalist clipboard buffering for Mac OS X.

##About
[Jumpcut](http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net/) has always been a great tool for managing clipboards.  It does one thing, and one thing only:  clipboard buffering.  No "useful features" that end up getting in your way, no "productivity enhancements" that you'll never use; just plain vanilla clipboard buffering.  Unfortunately, Jumpcut only works with plain text.  Cutup aims to do better.  Designed to emulate the look and feel of Jumpcut, Cutup's #2 goal (after buffering your clipboard) is staying out of your way.

##Status
Cutup is approaching the state of a somewhat usable beta, but I wouldn't trust it just yet.
